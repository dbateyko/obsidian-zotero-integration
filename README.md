## Obsidian Zotero Integration

Insert and import citations, bibliographies, notes, and PDF annotations from Zotero into Obsidian. Requires the [Better BibTeX for Zotero](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/) plugin.

You can find the documentation for this plugin [here](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration/blob/main/docs/README.md). The documentation is currently incomplete. Please reach out if you'd like to help.

## Help, how do I install the plugin?

In Obsidian, open Settings, on the left under Options open Community Plugins, on Community Plugins select Browse and search for 'Zotero Integration'

## Help, the plugin doesn't load!

Please insure your Obsidian installer version is at least `v0.13.24`. If not, try reinstalling obsidian.

## Help, I get an error when creating a citation or bibliography!

Please ensure you have selected a quick copy style in Zotero:

In the plugin settings, you'll now find **Enable .bib auto-sync** and **Auto-sync debounce delay (ms)** below the Better BibTeX `.bib` File path. Enabling auto-sync will watch your `.bib` file for changes and patch your notes' frontmatter accordingly.
